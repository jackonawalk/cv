    "Technical product manager, systems thinker, writer, and wanderer.",
  summary:
    "Iâ€™m a curious technologist stumbling into design and minimalism. I find joy in tidying up technology. Cooking with friends, long walks, and yoga help me find purpose. Streamlining life helps me stay focused on these priorities. A minimal wardrobe, few possessions, and unstructured time help me feel grounded.",
